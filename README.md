# Java Data Modelling Exercise

## Learning Objectives
- Explain that an Entity Relationship Diagram is used to visualise and define the implementation of a database
- Use user stories to design conceptual data models
- Use conceptual data models to design logical data models
- Use logical data models to design physical data models

## Instructions

Fork the repo as normal.

Create the Entity-Relationship Diagrams using whichever tool you feel works best for you.

Once you have a solution for each activity add it to this repo as an image.

Push your repo once you have completed the activities and create a Pull Request as normal.

## Core Exercise - Restaurant Booking System

#### Epic

‚ÄùA restaurant wants to introduce an online booking system for their main dining room, which has various tables. 
The restaurant is open throughout the day so customers can book for a variety of times and dates for
different size groups."

#### User Stories
- As a customer, so I can have a meal tomorrow night, I want to book a table at the restaurant.
- As the restaurant owner so that I can manage my business effectively I want to be able to alter the number of tables available at a given time.

Design a simplified booking system for this epic.

## Extension Exercises

Come up with User Stories (and possibly a more detailed Epic) for each of the following scenarios. 

Then design the database tables and relationships which would be needed to implement them.

1. A local candle maker wants to open an online store selling their handmade candles and other artifacts, they need a database system to use as part of this online shop. Details of customers need to be stored, products need to be stored and updated, a record of customer orders also needs to be maintained. Design the database system for the Candle Shop.

2. A car hire compnay with multiple locations wants to design an online system that will allow customers to book various cars, on various dates from different locations. Design the database system that would allow them to effectively manage their business.

3. A University library wishes to implement an online system for borrowing books and other items from the library. Each user will be able to borrow up to 6 items at a time.

4. When they originally launched Social Media sites such as Twitter, Identica, Diaspora and Mastodon all described themselves as micro-blogging sites, design a database schema for a similar micro-blogging Social Media site.

5. Think about an online learning system as used by a school, a university or a coding bootcamp, design the database tables etc that might be required to implement such a system.
