# Library User Stories

```
A University library wishes to implement an online system for 
borrowing books and other items from the library. 
Each user will be able to borrow up to 6 items at a time.

- As a student, I want to rent multiple books for my upcoming exam.
- As a teacher, I want to rent a relevant movie that i can show my students during class. 
- As a student, I am not finished with my book, I want to extent my current rental period.
- As a student, me and my friends live at campus and are bored and don't have a lot of money, 
we want to be able to rent different games.
- As a librarian, if someone fails to return the item after their rentperiode has ended, I want to add a late fee.
