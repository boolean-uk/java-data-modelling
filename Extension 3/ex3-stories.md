A University library wishes to implement an online system for borrowing books and other items from the library.
Each user will be able to borrow up to 6 items at a time.

- As a student I want to be able to borrow a book or item. 
- As the library manager of the University i want to see if books or items are borrowed.
- As the library manager i wish to see when a book is expected to be returned
- As a lazy student i wish to prolong my time borrowing the book so i can finish it in my own pace.
